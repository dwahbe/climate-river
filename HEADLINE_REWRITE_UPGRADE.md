## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. **Content-Enhanced Rewriting**

- Uses Defuddler-extracted article HTML/text when available
- Extracts first 600 characters (lede paragraphs) for context
- **5-layer safety system** prevents paywall/garbage content

### 2. **Techmeme-Inspired Prompt**

- Dense, factual, scannable style
- Climate-specific patterns for policy, legal, corporate, science, tech stories
- Includes 5 concrete example headlines
- Explicit guidance on numbers, specifics, structure

### 3. **Enhanced Validation**

- **Requires numbers** in every headline (Techmeme style)
- **Rejects vague language**: "game-changer", "revolutionary", "slams"
- **Rejects weak hedging**: "may", "could", "might", "possibly"
- **Climate context check**: Must include climate-related terms
- **Length optimization**: 80-170 chars (Techmeme density)

### 4. **Cost Optimizations**

- Reduced `maxOutputTokens` from 120 to 50 (headlines are short)
- Increased `temperature` from 0.2 to 0.3 (more natural phrasing)
- Content snippet limited to 600 chars (~150 tokens)

### 5. **Comprehensive Safety**

```
Layer 1: Database status check (only use content_status = 'success')
Layer 2: Minimum length (100 chars, 30 words)
Layer 3: Paywall detection (keyword scan)
Layer 4: Uniqueness ratio (30%+ unique words)
Layer 5: Detailed logging (track all rejections)
```

## üîß Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### 1. `scripts/schema.ts`

Added columns to articles table:

```sql
-- Content storage (from Defuddler)
content_html, content_text, content_word_count
content_status, content_error, content_fetched_at

-- Rewrite tracking
rewritten_title, rewritten_at, rewrite_model, rewrite_notes

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_content_status ON articles(content_status)
```

#### 2. `scripts/rewrite.ts` - Complete Rewrite

**New Functions:**

- `extractContentSnippet()` - Extracts lede with 5-layer safety
- `buildPrompt()` - Techmeme-style prompt with climate patterns
- `passesChecks()` - Enhanced validation with Techmeme requirements

**Updated Functions:**

- `fetchBatch()` - Now includes content fields
- `processOne()` - Uses content opportunistically with safeguards
- `generateWithOpenAI()` - Optimized parameters (temp 0.3, tokens 50)

**Key Parameters:**

```typescript
model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
temperature: 0.3 // Up from 0.2
maxOutputTokens: 50 // Down from 120
contentSnippet: 600 // Conservative limit
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mechanisms

### Content Rejection Scenarios

1. ‚úÖ **No content available** ‚Üí Falls back to title + dek
2. ‚úÖ **Status is 'paywall'** ‚Üí Skips content, uses title + dek
3. ‚úÖ **Content too short (<100 chars)** ‚Üí Rejects, uses title + dek
4. ‚úÖ **Paywall keywords detected** ‚Üí Rejects, uses title + dek
5. ‚úÖ **Too few words (<30)** ‚Üí Rejects, uses title + dek
6. ‚úÖ **Too repetitive (<30% unique)** ‚Üí Rejects, uses title + dek

### Headline Rejection Scenarios

1. ‚úÖ **No numbers** ‚Üí Fails validation
2. ‚úÖ **Too short/long** ‚Üí Fails validation
3. ‚úÖ **Vague language** ‚Üí Fails validation
4. ‚úÖ **Weak hedging** ‚Üí Fails validation
5. ‚úÖ **Not climate-related** ‚Üí Fails validation
6. ‚úÖ **Same as original** ‚Üí Fails validation

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Query: Content Usage Stats

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN rewrite_notes LIKE '%with_content%' THEN 'Used Content'
    WHEN rewrite_notes LIKE '%no_content%' THEN 'No Content'
    WHEN rewrite_notes LIKE '%paywall%' THEN 'Paywall'
    WHEN rewrite_notes LIKE '%content_rejected%' THEN 'Content Rejected'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END as content_status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(LENGTH(rewritten_title)) as avg_headline_length,
  AVG(LENGTH(rewritten_title) - LENGTH(title)) as avg_improvement
FROM articles
WHERE rewritten_at > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY content_status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Query: Quality Check

```sql
-- See examples of rejected content (to tune filters)
SELECT
  title,
  content_status,
  content_word_count,
  SUBSTRING(content_text, 1, 200) as preview
FROM articles
WHERE content_status = 'success'
  AND content_word_count < 150  -- Suspicious
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query: Headline Performance

```sql
-- Compare headline lengths with/without content
SELECT
  CASE WHEN rewrite_notes LIKE '%with_content%' THEN 'With Content' ELSE 'Without Content' END as type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(LENGTH(rewritten_title)) as avg_length,
  MIN(LENGTH(rewritten_title)) as min_length,
  MAX(LENGTH(rewritten_title)) as max_length
FROM articles
WHERE rewritten_at > now() - interval '7 days'
  AND rewritten_title IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY type;
```

## üéØ Techmeme Style Guide

### Structure Pattern

```
[WHO] [ACTION VERB] [WHAT with numbers], [WHY/IMPACT with details]
```

### Example Patterns by Story Type

**Policy:**

```
EPA finalizes power plant emissions rule, requiring coal facilities to cut CO2 80% by 2032, citing climate goals
```

**Corporate:**

```
√òrsted cancels 2.6GW New Jersey offshore wind project, cites supply chain costs and rate caps
```

**Legal:**

```
Federal appeals court blocks Mountain Valley Pipeline, citing insufficient climate impact review
```

**Science:**

```
Nature study finds Amazon emitting more CO2 than it absorbs, driven by 15% deforestation increase
```

**Technology:**

```
Form Energy demonstrates 100-hour iron-air battery, targets grid-scale seasonal storage
```

### Key Principles

1. **Lead with WHO** - Agency/company/court name first
2. **Numbers are mandatory** - $X billion, X%, X tons, X GW
3. **Specific entities** - "EPA" not "regulators", "√òrsted" not "company"
4. **Present tense** - "announces" not "announced"
5. **No hype** - Show with numbers, don't tell with adjectives
6. **Comma-separated clauses** - Natural flow, not complex sentences

```bash
npx tsx scripts/schema.ts
```

### Test with specific limit

```bash
npx tsx scripts/rewrite.ts --limit 5
```

---

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Short Term (Week 1)

- ~10-20% of headlines use article content (depending on reader usage)
- Headlines become noticeably more specific and informative
- Users click through more due to better preview information

### Medium Term (Month 1)

- As reader view usage grows, more articles have cached content
- Headline quality improves proportionally
- Can measure engagement lift through click analytics

### Long Term (Optional)

- Consider adding content prefetch step for lead articles
- Monitor which content sources provide best quality
- A/B test different snippet lengths

---

## üéâ Success Metrics

Track these to measure impact:

1. **Content Usage Rate**
   - % of rewrites using article content
   - Target: 30%+ within 1 month

2. **Headline Quality**
   - Avg headline length (target: 120-150 chars)
   - % containing numbers (target: 80%+)
   - % passing all validation checks (target: 70%+)

3. **User Engagement**
   - Click-through rate on rewritten headlines
   - Time on article (shows headline accurately represented content)

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Monthly OpenAI spend (should stay under $0.10)
   - Cost per quality headline

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If headlines are too short

- Check if content is being fetched successfully
- Review `content_status` distribution
- May need to adjust validation thresholds

### If too many rejections

- Review console warnings during rewrite
- Check specific patterns causing failures
- May need to tune validation rules

### If cost increases unexpectedly

- Check average content snippet length in logs
- Verify maxOutputTokens is still 50
- Review temperature and retries settings
